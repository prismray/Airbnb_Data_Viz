# Airbnb_Data_Viz

#### Authors: Aashka Aradhya and Rico Rey Holganza

Airbnb is a company based in San Francisco that operates an online marketplace and hospitality service for people to lease or rent short-term lodging. I love travelling and have used Airbnb whenever I have the option to and would love to work for them. That's why I decided to analyze data scraped from their website to present interesting insights and visualizations.

#### **This project has used San Francisco Airbnb data scraped from their website on Aug 16th 2018. I used the following datasets available on the link  :** http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html

* **listings_summary.csv:** Detailed information about each listing such as description, host name, geo-coordinates and so on
* **listngs.csv:** The datasets contains 6,663 listings in the city of San Francisco with details such as: Property Type, Neighbourhood, Price, Number of Reviews, Availability for the next year as seen on their website on August 16th, 2018
* **calendar.csv:** Daily prices of each property in San Francisco from Aug'18 to Aug '19

## **Metric I defined to structure my analysis:**

* **Property Density:** This defines the density level of each property type (Entire Home, Private Room and Shared Room ) for each neighbourhood in San Francisco

* **Occupancy Rate:** (Days Occupied in between Aug 16 '18 to Nov 16 '18 (90 days) / 90 Days) * 100

## **The questions my analysis aims to answer:**

### **1. Which combination of property type and density level has highest occupancy?**
